Once you do, an app gets downloaded that asks for basic permissions. But in reality, it’s accessing everything on your phone—your contacts, payment apps, and even storing your passwords using a keylogger. Scammers can then steal your data and log into your accounts.

1️⃣ Microsoft China Bans Android Devices: 
Microsoft has instructed its employees in China and Hong Kong to switch from Android smartphones to iPhones by September 2024. Microsoft’s decision is due to the unavailability of Google Play Store in mainland China and aims to ensure access to essential Microsoft apps via Apple’s iOS App Store. Are you surprised that the Apple App Store is available in China but not Google Play Store? 😳

2️⃣ JioTag Air, alternative to Apple AirTag launches at ₹1,499: 
That’s half the price of the Apple AirTag. Reliance has introduced the JioTag Air, priced at ₹1,499, as an affordable alternative to Apple’s AirTag, which costs ₹2,999. Compatible with both Android and iOS devices, JioTag Air integrates with Apple’s Find My network and JioThings app. It’s designed for tracking items like keys, wallets, and pets, offering features such as a 12-month battery life and loud sound alerts. Available in vibrant Red, Blue, and Gray colours. Could this destroy the market for Apple AirTags? 🤔

3️⃣ Samsung Phone Breaks Rs. 2 Lakh Price Barrier! 
The new Galaxy Z Fold 6 just became the most expensive smartphone in India with a price of Rs. 2,00,999, beating the iPhone 15 Pro Max 1TB at Rs. 1,99,000. This beast packs 1TB storage, 12GB RAM, and 20+ AI features like drawing assets, homework solving, and a language interpreter. Do you think the Galaxy Z Fold 6 will start a new era of phone prices?

There are 3 big problems that people face when using regular hard drives for CCTV recordings: 

1) They are not designed for long continuous usage. 
2) They typically don’t have enhanced technology 
that helps reduce data loss or missing frames from footage.
3) They are not typically tested in systems that operate 24 hours a day.
