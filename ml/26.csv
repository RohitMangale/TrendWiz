“I don’t browse in bookshops, I browse in libraries, where you can take a book home and read it, and if you like it you go to a bookshop and buy it.”

- Helene Hanff

If you love books and letters, then you have to read this book! It was such a delightful experience to read Helene’s witty letters to Frank. Helene lived in New York and Frank worked for Marks & co. booksellers in London. This book contains their correspondence for almost two decades which began in 1949 and ended in 1969, when Mark died. 

This volume contains two books - ‘84 Charring Cross Road’ and ‘The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street’. Super excited to start the second one!

‘Tucked away down a Kyoto backstreet lies the extraordinary Kamogawa Diner. Running this unique establishment are a father-daughter duo who serve more than just mouth-watering feasts.

The pair have reinvented themselves as ‘food detectives’, offering a service that goes beyond traditional dining. Through their culinary sleuthing, they reconstruct beloved dishes from the memories of their customers, creating a connection to cherished moments from the past.

Among those who seek an appointment include: a one-hit wonder pop star, finally ready to leave Tokyo and give up on her singing career, wants to try the tempura that she ate to celebrate her only successful record and a budding Olympic swimmer who desires the bento lunch box that his estranged father used to make him. The Kamogawa Diner doesn’t just serve meals – it revives lost recipes and rekindles forgotten memories. It’s a doorway to the past through the miracle of delicious food.’

Can’t wait to read this one!!

“That’s the allure of books – it’s not just the story between the covers, but the story of where they came from, who owned them. A book is so much more than a delivery vehicle for its contents.”

A book about book lover protagonists, covering all the elements of a good read for me, like romance, historical fiction and mystery! I decided to read this book when I came across a quote from it on @goodreads 

The story progresses from the perspective of three people - Martha, Henry and Opaline. Martha has fled home to get away from her abusive husband and gets a job as a housekeeper in Dublin. Henry is looking for a lost bookshop, that will help him find the manuscript of a book, he is writing his PhD thesis based on. Opaline’s narration takes place in the 1920s when she runs away from her brother to become a rare book dealer.

All of their stories are connected in one way or the other. The lady called Madame Bowden, who Martha works for, is hiding something. Henry has already been in the bookshop when he first arrived in Dublin but can’t seem to find it despite multiple attempts of searching at the same location. Opaline is making her name in history as a famous rare book dealer, when she gets pregnant and is incarcerated by her brother.

A dual timeline novel with a subtle touch of magical realism, this book is every bit of captivating and brilliant! One of my favourite reads of this year without a doubt!

What an absolutely beautiful book! A book that evokes deeply hidden emotions with every turn of the page with four incredibly heart-touching stories that leave you wanting for more! This is my first read from the series and I genuinely regret not reading the earlier books. 

Funiculi Funicula is a cafe in Tokyo that makes it possible to travel to the past or to the future to meet someone you love. But there are some rules that you must follow in order to do this.

The stories take us on an emotional journey in the cafe where a seven year old boy wants to smile for his divorced parents, a woman wants to meet her dead husband to name their child, a girl wants to meet her best friend and a father wants to meet his daughter from whom he hasn’t heard for years.

Please go and read this book already! I am sure you’ll love it too!

Thanks a ton @panmacmillanindia for sending this wonderful book my way!

“Whatever is awaiting me is awaiting me. For now, let’s live.”

Matt Haig has been one of my favourite authors for a couple of years now. He’s never failed to amaze me with his beautiful perspective of life that is evident in all of his books. I have a similar reaction for this one too!

It is the story of Grace, a seventy-two year old lady, who is quite alone in the world. She had been a mathematics teacher and one of her students writes her a letter telling about his troubles. In reply, Grace writes him a wonderful story that she was lucky enough to have experienced at that age!

The story takes place on the Spanish island of Ibiza. I’ve been there before, but I regret not exploring it as described in the book. I found some instances in the book hard to believe, but after-all it’s fiction and supposed to be like that. Haig’s clever words have left me amazed as always!

“Books are mirrors: you only see in them what you already have inside you.”
- Carlos Ruiz Zafón, The Shadow of the Wind

Didn’t do much reading last month as too many things got in the way. Tbh, I read only one complete book in September that is The Book of Bullah. But I did read a major part of Before we Forget Kindness too, so I thought it’s better to have two books in the wrap-up. Also, I majorly read The Shadow of the Wind last month, haven’t finished it yet though.

So here is the list and respective ratings:

1. The Book of Bullah 🌟🌟🌟🌟
2. Before we forget Kindness 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟

“I dance madly in the throes of love
In love’s madness I dance away”

Bulleh Shah was a Sufi Saint who lived from 1680 to 1758. To this day, the glimpses of the verses written by him can be seen in many songs and poems.

Translated from Punjabi, his words hold the same power even in English. While reading this book, I couldn’t stop thinking why I hadn’t read his poetry before. From love to caste to God, his verses are hard-hitting and brilliant!

A must have and a must-read book for poetry lovers!

What does it mean to let go . . . ?

After the death of his best friend, Eric Ly creates imaginary scenarios in his head to deal with his grief. Until one of them becomes real, and a boy he met last summer – Haru Tanaka – walks into the coffee shop and sits down next to him. The only thing is, nobody else can see him.

Eric suddenly has someone to connect with, making him feel less alone in the world. But as they spend more time together, he begins to question what is real. Soon Eric is losing control of the very thing that is holding him together, and must confront his reality. Even if it means losing Haru forever.

""Every problem could be solved if people tried hard enough.""

....is the firm belief of eleven year-old Benjamiah Creek. His parents are going through a rough patch in their marriage and  have taken a few days off to go away to sort their differences. He is left to care for their bookshop alongwith his grandmother. Benjamiah does not believe in magic, he only understands science, logic and the power of reason.

Imagine his surprise when a doll, more like a poppet, arrives in the mail addressed to him! He doesn't know why his parents would send him the last thing he wants. But this doll is much more than it appears. To Benjamiah's horror, it sometimes turns into a bird and sometimes into a monkey!

This doll leads him into another world, similar but much different than his own called Wreathenwold. It holds dark secrets in it's labyrinthine streets. Here he meets the headstrong Elizabella, who cannot rest till she finds her brother, Edwid. 

Will Benjamiah return home safe and sound? Will they find Edwid? Read to know!

Have you ever thought where a person goes after they die? Do they completely vanish from the face of the earth, go straight to heaven or their soul lingers on for sometime? There are too many possible answers to these questions and none of these can be confirmed with certainty.

This book features Mr Hirasaka's photography studio in the mountains. It's an in-between place after a person dies and before they go to heaven. When a person comes here, they get to see a photograph for each day they have lived. Then they have to select a single photograph for each year that will go in the lantern of lost memories! When this lantern spins, it's like taking a walk down the memory lane!

This book has three stories, one of ninety-two year old Hatsue who was a nursery teacher and found her purpose in her work. Another is a yakuza (criminal) called Waniguchi, who can't stop talking about the weird shop help he'd hired for pretenses, called Mouse. The last one is a little girl called Mitsuru, who is still not quite dead, yet! Mr Hirasaka lives everyone's stories with them but has no clue about where he himself came from!

I adored the simplicity and honesty of this book. It is a one-of-a-kind read that leaves a strong impact on you. Highly recommended!

Thank you @panmacmillan for letting me be a part of this tour!

“maybe that’s all love is. So much is how we perceive someone and the memories we have of them, rather than the facts of who they are. Maybe instead of saying I love you we should say I imagine you.”
-Dolly Alderton, Ghosts

Here is the list of Books I read in August with their respective ratings:
1. Eleanor and Park (Reread) 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
2. Ghosts 🌟🌟🌟🌟.5
3. Good Material 🌟🌟🌟🌟
4. Till Fate do us Part 🌟🌟🌟.5
5. The Lantern of Lost Memories 🌟🌟🌟🌟.5

August was an exhausting month - physically, mentally and emotionally. I got admitted into a hospital for the first time and it was a scary experience for me. A lot of difficult decision making had to be seen through. But it also helped me shift my perspective to a better one! It is leaving me with a more rejuvenated mindset and I am nothing but grateful for going through this trying month.

“feeling so grateful that I have this person in my life who sees me more clearly than I can see myself.”

I have read plenty of books about breakups, but never narrated from a male perspective. I never thought men had this level of emotional vulnerability. That’s the reason I was not really sure if I’d be able to like this one. But I was in for a surprise as I couldn’t stop turning page after page until I’d finally finished reading the story!

Andy is thirty-five and a stand-up comedian. His girlfriend, Jen, whom he has been dating for almost four years, just broke up with him and he can’t figure out why. He’ll go to any end to know the reason. His career is going nowhere, his friends are busy with their marriage or kids and he doesn’t even have a place to live!

Everything he does, everywhere he goes, everyone he sees, reminds him of Jen one way or the other. They were so good together and without her, Andy finds himself lost with a head full of negative thoughts. But he doesn’t know Jen’s side of the story, yet!

Dolly Alderton has a way with words that go straight to your heart. Her honesty and brilliance knows no bounds. Now I can say with a lot of conviction that I’ll happily read her grocery lists too!

Huge thanks to @penguinindia for introducing me to Dolly and her amazing talent!

“You don’t manufacture feelings; feelings come to you.”

The story starts at Dr Gaurang Doshi’s clinic. He is a paediatric orthopedist. One fine day, a special needs child, Sameeksha, visits him with her parents. Dr Doshi finds himself surprisingly drawn to her mother, Vedika, without even seeing her face as it is covered by a mask. He finds her eyes very attractive and communicative. But he hesitates to take a step as she is married.

He has no idea that Vedika and her husband, Rohan are going through their divorce besides caring for Vedika. They both lead quite hectic professional lives, but Vedika will go to any end for her daughter. Gaurang is the first doctor who has been so cooperative regarding Sameeksha’s condition. She also feels herself drawn to Dr Gaurang for some reason.

What will Vedika and Gaurang do with their mutual feelings? How will it affect the people around them? Read to know!

Right from page one, this story captivated me with its strong wordplay and brilliant plot. This is my third book by Smita and every time I am more and more surprised by her incredible storytelling talent!

“Looking for love didn’t have to be factored into my schedule in the way I’d dreaded – I could do it while watching TV.”

Long story short - I loved reading this book, it felt very comforting to read about someone’s imperfect life. I recommend everyone read it once!

Nina George Dean has just turned thirty-two. For a moment, she thinks she has a perfect life - she has a handsome boyfriend who loves her, a new apartment that she bought herself and a job she loves! 

But it doesn’t take a second’s notice for it all to crumble! Her boyfriend, Max, whom she met on a dating website called Linx, ghosts her after saying I Love You. Her downstairs neighbour is a nightmare. Her father is sick and her mother seems unbothered about it. Her ex is getting married and all her other friends are either engaged or pregnant. 

As Nina grapples with pangs of loneliness, she is hit by nostalgia more than once and reflects on how easy it was to be a child. Sometimes, adulting takes it all out of her.

I liked that the book didn’t focus on a perfect ending. The rawness, honesty and simplicity of the prose impressed me endlessly. As I am reading my second novel by Dolly, I wish I’d discovered her brilliant self sooner!

“Every life has its kernel, its hub, its epicentre, from which everything flows out, to which everything returns.”

This is the second book I read by Maggie and it’s also my second favourite. The story is based on the legendary play, Hamlet by Shakespeare.

Set in the 16th century, in a little village in England, Hamnet and Judith are twins. Their mother, Agnes is recognised as a strange woman in their neighbourhood, because she has untamed looks and prefers the wilderness to the seclusion of society life.

One day, when Judith falls violently ill, Hamnet searches the whole of their house and even their grandparent’s house for help. But all of sudden everyone seems to have gone somewhere in this desperate time of need.

Will he manage to save his sister? What will he be ready to sacrifice in place of his sister’s life? What will be the consequences?

The book is brilliantly written but the story failed to hold my attention for longer spans. I expected this to be a five star read but it turned out to be a bit of a disappointment.

""Just because you think it’s safe here, it doesn’t mean this is the right place for you, her heart countered. Sometimes where you feel most safe is where you least belong.""

This story begins when the protagonist dies. It is narrated from her perspective as she recalls all the significant moments of her life, when her brain is working for the last 10 minutes and 38 seconds before shutting down forever.

This is the story of Leila, a girl born in the small town of Van in Turkey. She is a prostitute who is murdered and her body is found dumped in a garbage bin in Istanbul. But her brain is still functioning. She recalls everything from her birth, to her running away from home to Istanbul, her marriage, the night she was murdered and all the people who made a mark in her life before she takes her last breath.

A one of kind story that brings into focus the life of the people working in the shadows. It talks about a cemetery in Istanbul for the companionless and the painful stories associated with it. Read this book keeping in mind the trigger warnings. It is a sad book but an eye-opening one at that. Nonetheless, brilliantly written and beautifully crafted by miss Shafak!

“There are a few times in life when you leap up and the past that you’d been standing on falls away behind you, and the future you mean to land on is not yet in place, and for a moment you’re suspended knowing nothing and no one, not even yourself.”

I don’t know what I expected from this book, but I was not surprised by it. It felt like reading about someone’s day to day mundane life. There were no interesting twists as such, just the story of a family drama in which the house takes the centre stage.

Cyril Conroy lands the one-of-a-kind Dutch House by sheer luck after world war II. He lives there with his wife and two children, Maeve and Danny. His wife abandons them because she thinks no one should live in such grandeur. He remarries another woman named Andrea who has her own two daughters. After the death of their father, Andrea asks Danny to move out of the house. He lives with his sister for a while before starting college. 

The prose is brilliant but the story failed to grip my attention. It was nothing out of the ordinary I feel. The only extraordinary element in the story is the house. A one-time read!

A book that disappointed you recently?

“I want to do something splendid...something heroic or wonderful that won’t be forgotten after I’m dead. I don’t know what, but I’m on the watch for it and mean to astonish you all someday.”

This is one of the first books I ever read and it is the closest to my heart. I have reread it several times over the years. Watched the movie and even the cartoon series based on it. I find comfort in this book, in the beautiful bond between the sisters and their mother, in their journey of self-discovery and in the relatability I find with each one of them in one way or another.

This book is the story of four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy living in New England with their mother. Their father is away at war. Money is not easy to come. Every sister has her own unique ability that makes them interesting. They struggle to indulge their desires or to think about others in the family.

Jo is my all time favourite character. Even in the 19th century, she wanted to be an independent woman and make a good life for her family. This book feels like home to me. There’s so much to learn and reflect over between its pages. You should definitely read it at least once!

A big thanks to @penguinrandomhouse for sending this beautiful edition my way!

“A map is a two-dimensional representation with arbitrary symbols and incised lines that decide who is to be our enemy and who is to be our friend, who deserves our love and who deserves our hatred and who, our sheer indifference. Cartography is another name for stories told by winners. For stories told by those who have lost, there isn’t one.”

The first book I read by Shafak was a few years ago - ‘The Forty Rules of Love’, and I still can’t stop praising it. When an opportunity came to read this one for a bookclub, I couldn’t holdback, as it was on my TBR for so long. And it turned out to be quite worth the wait!

Ada is a teenager, living in London with her father. Her mother died a year ago. When asked to talk about the topic of her origin in class, Ada started screaming out of nowhere and couldn’t stop herself even when her mind was telling her otherwise. This incident made Ada feel very embarrassed as all her classmates were looking at her like she had gone crazy! Her father was called to take her home.

Ada’s parents came from Cyprus, an island nation in the Mediterranean. Her father was Greek and her mother was Turkish, which was a grave problem for two people who intended to spend their lives together in Cyprus. Escaping from the harrowing past of their nation, they decided to move to London to start a new life for themselves and their child. They tried their best never to talk about their past when Ada was around. But it’s not that easy to escape your origins!

While coming to London, Ada’s father carried with him a branch of a fig tree he wanted to plant in their new garden. The story is also narrated from the perspective of this tree. The book not only talks about the adverse effects of war on people, but also about what it does to trees and animals. You get to know about a lot of interesting facts about them too!

This book is a brilliant tale of love, belonging, loss and nature!  Undoubtedly one of the best books I’ve read this year!

I hadn’t heard of this book or this author before. I decided to pick it up on a whim in the library because the title appealed to me, given my love for traveling. After finishing reading it, I want to read more books by this author!

The story takes us to Florence, where the main character, Kathy Courage is attending her boyfriend Neil’s brother’s wedding. Kathy has been in a relationship with Neil for almost half a decade. She is used to his children’s and his endless tantrums and her own wishes always take a backseat with them around. At the wedding reception, Neil proposes to her and she has to say yes because of all the people looking at them. Nonetheless, she is quite delighted to visit her dream destination, Florence and decides to make the most of this trip.

She meets a musician, Henry, while playing the piano in the hotel. They sit down to play together and have a really great time. The day after the wedding, there is some mix up with the flights and Kathy finds herself in Florence for another three days, to her utter amusement! She meets Henry again by chance and senses a mutual connection. 

She gets time to reflect on her life and to decide what she really wants to do. All her life she made decisions based on other people’s choices, but now is the time to choose herself, like her father always wanted!

I loved the simplicity and honesty of this story. I could relate to Kathy’s character on so many levels. One of the most underrated uplifting rom-coms out there. Read this one for a good laugh and a wonderful time!

""Most people trusted in the future, assuming that their preferred version of it would unfold. Blindly planning for it, envisioning things that weren’t the case. This was the working of the will. This was what gave the world purpose and direction. Not what was there but what was not.""

A multi-generational saga of love, loss and self-discovery, Lowland is yet another example of Lahiri's witty storytelling. It is the story of two brothers, Udayan and Subhash, who are as different in their thoughts as they are alike in their looks.

Set in the neighborhood of Tollygunge in Calcutta, the two brothers grew up sharing almost everything. While Udayan wanted to make the world around him a different place, Subhash was more bent towards personal development. Udayan chose the path of rebellion to fulfill his ambition and Subhash moved to the States to chase his aspirations.

Udayan married a girl named Gauri, whom his parents disapproved of. He informed Subhash with a letter. Sometime later, another letter came bearing the news of Udayan's sudden death. Subhash flied back to India to support his parents in this time of grief. He learnt that Udayan was shot by the police. He also met his brother's widow, Gauri. In order to protect her from his parents' further disapproval, he arranged for her to come to live with him in the States after marrying her.

Gauri was pregnant with Udayan's child. She gave birth to a girl, whom they named Bela. While Subhash couldn't be more happy to have a child, Gauri didn't have a clue on how to love her. She even couldn't make herself accept Subhash as her husband. How did their small family survive this upheaval of emotions? Read to know!

The first half of the book is a bit slow, but the second one is quite interesting as many things happen all at once. Although I didn't like it as much as the namesake, it was a good read one-time overall!

“there is too much of the world and too little of life.”

Alternating between two timelines, the present and the first half of the twentieth century, Great Circle is the story of Marian Graves, a pilot who is brave enough to fulfil her life’s dream - flying a Great Circle around the Earth and Hadley Baxter, a Hollywood actress, who lost her parents in a plane crash and is also working on a movie based on Marian’s life.

Marian’s life has always been something far from the ordinary. She and her twin brother, Jamie, were rescued by their father from a flaming sinking ship, when they were newborn babies. Later, their father went to prison on false charges and they were sent to live with their uncle, Wallace, in Montana. It is here that Marian first discovered her immense passion for flying and the price she was willing to pay for it.

During her final flight of completing the Great Circle, her plane disappeared when she flew from the inhospitable continent of Antarctica towards New Zealand. Everyone believes that she dies then and there, collapsing the plane into the ocean, never to be discovered again. But there could be something more to the story, only if you are willing to dig deeper into the mystery!

This book is a 593 page tome, but every page in it is as interesting as the one before. Marian’s story is quite inspiring, demonstrating brilliantly the lengths a person would go to follow their heart. I loved every single bit of this unique story and would definitely recommend it to everyone!

“All those moments throughout the days, weeks, months that don’t get marked on calendars with hand-drawn stars or little stickers.

Not grand gestures, but mundane details that, over time, accumulate until you have a home, instead of a house.
The things that matter.
The things I can’t stop longing for.”

A collection of five witty short stories, Welcome to Paradise explores the themes of tragedy, love, longing, heartbreak and humour. With stories narrated in a clean and concise manner, it is a must-read book by an Indian author!

The first story ‘The Man from the Garage’ is about loss and fun banters in a family setting. The next one is about a lonely woman who enjoys chatting with strangers online. The third one called ‘Nearly Departed’ is my favourite one! It is about an eighty-six year old woman who writes a letter to the chief justice of India to legalise euthanasia. The next tale is about the dynamics of a married couple’s life and the last one is the story of a woman’s survival after the death of her son.

I loved how straightforward Khanna’s writing is! It is simple yet impactful and every story has a brilliant structure. Would definitely recommend this one to those who like reading short stories!

So, I’ve decided to do this post every week, so that I’d have some update to share about what I am reading, watching, listening to and looking forward to!

📖What I am Reading
I am currently reading A Gentleman in Moscow, Welcome to Paradise and The Lost Bookshop. Have kept the first one aside for a while as it was going too slow for my liking. Enjoying the other two though!

🎬What I am watching 
Started rewatching Friends! My all-time favourite comfort show. Also watched two movies this week - Six Underground and the Lost City, both were alright for a one-time watch.

🎵What I am listening to
Listening to ‘I want it that way’ a lot these days. I love the energy of that song. Also listening to some 90s Bollywood songs on the side.

⏩What I am looking forward to
I am looking forward to some clarity regarding my professional choices. Also, trying to keeping up with the instagram algorithm is proving to be a bit frustrating. Looking forward to figuring that out too!

“The same universe that dispassionately takes things away can bring you things you weren’t imaginative enough to dream up.”

I love Emily Henry! I can proudly say that I’ve read every book of hers and hope she writes many more. The thing I admire the most about her stories is the relatable and flawed characters, and how much heart she puts into them.

This one is her newest release. It is the story of Daphne, a librarian, who is recently dumped by her fiancé, after his bachelor party, where he hooks up with his best friend. His best friend is Miles’ girlfriend. As Daphne can’t find any other place to live in, after the abruptly shocking break-up, she moves in with Miles!

As fate would have it, Miles and Daphne decide to fake date each other in order to teach a lesson to their respective exes, but end up having real feelings for each other instead! They bond over their heartbreaks and end up with something a lot better than either of them could have expected.

Emily paints such a beautiful background, where the story takes place in Lake Michigan, that I am seriously considering visiting it! I love the small town vibe and the interesting characters. Go and read it already!

“We are all living, at most, half of a life, she thought. There was the life you lived, which consisted of the choices you made. And then, there was the other life, the one that was the things you hadn’t chosen.”

Sam & Sadie first meet at a hospital & they bond over gaming. sadie is visiting her sister & Sam is recovering from a terrible car crash. They share a mutual love for video games as it offers them an opportunity to escape their mundane lives.

Eight years later, they meet at a crowded train Station in Boston. They converse like no time has passed at all and start working on a project that they both love from the bottom of their hearts. They make games that make them famous, along-with their partner, Marx. But soon, success starts to get to their heads!

This book made me nostalgic about the video games I used to play as a child. It is a beautifully written heartwarming story of success, love, friendship, passion & tragedy. My best read of the year so far!

“You could be my entire world. If you let me.”

Reading Ali Hazelwood feels like staying in bed all day eating icecream and watching your favourite comfort movie. I love how her writing consumes me, my thoughts and takes me to an entirely different setting than the one I am in.

This is the story of Elsie, an aspiring theoretical physicist, who does everything in her power to make ends meet, to fuel her passion. She makes some money on a fake dating site called Faux and she also teaches like a hundred classes per week, as an adjunct professor. One of her fake dating customers is Greg. Greg has an older brother, Jack, whom Elsie confuses to be a physical education instructor or something like that.

But it turns out that Jack is quite the superstar in the world of Experimental Physics! Almost a decade ago, he wrote an article that put the world of Theoretical Physics to shame and it greatly affected Elsie. When she finds out the truth about Jack, she hates him with every nerve in her body!

But Jack makes it clear, when he gets the chance, that he is infatuated with Elsie. Elsie can’t make sense of his attraction to her as she is convinced that people won’t like her for who she actually is. That’s why she tries to become whatever other people want her to be, keeping her real self hidden from the world. But Jack sees through her charade. Will they end up together? Read to know!

Read this one if you love a good rom-com with some swoon-worthy moments and heart-touching character lines!

“Life could go on forever like this, I thought. Life would, if I didn’t take action.”

I read only one book last month - My year of Rest and Relaxation, I’d rate it 🌟🌟🌟. While this book was quite intriguing at times, it depressed me to no end. It’s about a woman who is done with life and decides to sleep for a year with the help of a ton of drugs. Her life’s been quite traumatising and hence her response to life is but quite obvious. I’d recommend reading it at your own risk though!

Also, I got married last month! This new year brought a lot of new beginnings for me and it’s been very beautiful so far ✨

How’s the new year been for you so far?

“You don’t need stars, Riley. You are one. You have your own gravity and I cannot fucking wait to see what you do with it.”

I read ‘Begin Again’ by Emma Lord last year, and I was quite impressed by her simple yet impactful storytelling skills. The Getaway List is a refreshing new story by the author about two childhood friends, Riley and Tom, who haven’t met each other for the past three years, but still have managed to stay in touch.

On the day of her high school graduation, Riley realises that she has absolutely no idea what to do with her life. She decides to pack her bags and go meet her best friend, Tom in New York and get started on the Getaway List - A list of all the adventures they’d planned to do together!

Once Riley meets Tom, she realises that their bond is as strong as ever but there is something different about him, something she can’t quite put her finger on. As they get started on ticking items off the getaway list, they make new friends and discover what the other is feeling.

The idea of this book is quite interesting but reading it was not. I didn’t enjoy it as much as I’d hoped. But overall, the characters are relatable and the writing is easy to follow.

“At some point in a woman’s life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time. After that, she is free to become whoever she truly is.”

This was my first read by Elizabeth Gilbert and it sure won’t be my last! She writes a brilliantly captivating prose, drawing you inside the story bit by bit and once it’s over, you are left wanting for more.

Nineteen year old Vivian Morris has just been kicked out of Vassar college due to her lack of interest in studies. Her parents can’t wait to get rid of her and send her off to live with her aunt, Lily in New York. Lily runs a theatre called the Lily Playhouse, that opens up a new world of possibilities for Vivian. She meets all kinds of people there and is fascinated by everyone in some way or the other.

Vivian has the time of her life in the city with her newly acquainted gal pals, so much so that she doesn’t know when she crosses the line from fun to scandal! 

Set against the glamorous backdrop of 1940s New York, this story has all the elements of a brilliant historical fiction - War, love, friendship and tragedy! It has been my best read this year so far!

“Not to have been born in a woman’s body was a piece of luck in the first place: he couldn’t see his own freedom because he couldn’t conceive of how elementally it might have been denied him... The wounded don’t survive in nature: a woman could never throw herself on fate and expect to come out of it intact. She has to connive at her own survival...”

I couldn’t find a better day to post about this book than today, which happens to be International Women’s Day! This book is the story of a woman who has felt out of place all her life, second guessing everything from being a mother to being a wife. 

The story is about a Woman who lives on a remote island with her husband. She invites a famous artist to stay at their place for a while. She idolises this man and when he doesn’t act respectfully towards her, she starts questioning her entire being. She treats herself as flawed, meanwhile, everyone around her seems perfectly content in their own skin.

I liked the sharp beauty of Cusk’s writing. The story has many layers to it, but it didn’t captivate me as much as I had expected.

“I want in fact more of you. In my mind I am dressing you with light; I am wrapping you up in blankets of complete acceptance and then I give myself to you. I long for you; I who usually long without longing, as though I am unconscious and absorbed in neutrality and apathy, really, utterly long for every bit of you.”

I’ve been wanting to read this book since I first heard about it in a Turkish drama about three years ago. The idea of such a beautiful book seemed very intriguing to me then. I finally bought it a couple of months ago and started reading it as soon as I could!

This book comprises of a series of letters written by the author Franz Kafka to Milena Jesenská. She was the translator of his books. Gradually, they developed a deep attachment to each other, as is quite evident from Kafka’s letters.

I took my sweet time reading this book, as I soaked my mind in its brilliance and beauty, word by word!

“How foolish to think you can tell your children about yourself before they’re at least fifty. To ask to be seen by them as a person and not as a function. To say : I am your history, you begin from me, listen to me, it could be useful to you.”

Leda takes a vacation at the beach after a very long time. She is a divorced mother of two girls. As she begins her holiday of leisure, she reflects upon the difficult days when her kids were growing up. She meets another family on the beach and a woman Nina and her daughter, Elena catch her interest. Observing their traits from a distance, Leda thinks about her own role as a mother.

Blurb:

In the autumn of 2011, the postman-turned-journalist Daniel Bosley embarked on an unexpected adventure which started as an internship in London’s Maldives High Commission – the diplomatic mission of the Indian Ocean tourism hotspot. Little did he know that he would soon set off on an odyssey through an imperilled island nation undergoing one of the most tumultuous periods in its history.

Over the next seven years, Bosley worked as a journalist in the Maldives, reporting on its volatile political landscape and shattering the picture-perfect view of this supposed paradise. Taking us into a nation of a thousand isles, he reveals a shaded past of sultans, imperialists and Western explorers before a modern-day dictatorship was finally overturned by a democracy that immediately plunged into turmoil. While dissenters and intrepid reporters faced abduction, imprisonment, and even death, the climate crisis and Islamist zealots posed ever greater threats to the country’s vulnerable environment and its ancient culture. As the editor of the Maldives’ main English-language news website, Bosley witnessed some of these events first-hand, his personal distress assuaged only by the love and hope he would come to find – against all odds – within these isolated atoll communities.

Richly observed and infused with empathy and essential humour, Descent into Paradise thoroughly alters our understanding of the Maldives, a place where magical waters and surreal skies hide unthinkable dangers even as the struggle for justice risks submersion.

A splendid work of translated Kannada fiction, Sakina’s Kiss is the story of a man called Venkat, who lives in a flat in Bangalore with his wife and daughter. One evening, two young men knock on his door asking to speak with his daughter regarding some important business. He informs them that his daughter has gone to their hometown, where there’s no network, so she can’t be contacted immediately. But they insist that they get in touch with her as soon as possible.

This incident troubles Venkat and he tries to contact his daughter but isn’t successful. He is bewildered by her sudden disappearance and recalls their past arguments. Sometimes, his thoughts take him back to the highlights of his childhood in the village.

This book was a good read but the social political background, in which it is set, didn’t interest me much. It nicely explains the dynamics of family life in a modern world. Overall, it’s fine for a one time read!

Nora is a brilliant surgeon. She is in her mid thirties and is still not ready to start a family as she is scared of the darkness within her. She is afraid to pass on her father’s genes to the next generation. Her father is in prison since the last twenty six years. He was a serial killer, who went by the name of ‘Handyman’. He’d killed almost thirty women and cutoff their hands to preserve their bones as souvenirs.

One day as Nora is sitting at her usual bar, drinking her usual Old-fashioned drink, she meets Brady, who was her boyfriend in college. They dated for sometime and she can’t remember why they broke up. Around the same time, two of Nora’s patients, both young women with dark hair and blue eyes are found murdered in the same manner like her father killed his victims. Nora is a suspect due to her multiple connections to these murders. Who is out there to get her? Will Nora discover the culprit? Read to know!

Just as dark and intriguing as Freida’s other books, The Locked Door is a gripping psychological thriller that you won’t be able to stop reading till you find the truth!

Paris, 1974. Radha is now thirty-two and living in Paris with her husband, Pierre, and their two daughters. She still grieves for the baby boy she gave up years ago, when she was only a child herself, but she loves being a mother to her daughters, and she's finally found her passion--the treasure trove of scents.

When her friend's grandfather had offered her a job at his parfumerie, she quickly discovered she had a talent-she could find the perfect fragrance for any customer who walked chrough the door. Now, ten years later, she's working for a master perfumer, helping to design completely new fragrances for clients and building her career one scent at a time. She only wishes Pierre could understand her need to work. She feels his frustration, but she can't give up the thing that drives her.

Tasked with her first major project, Radha travels to India, where she enlists the help of her sister, Lakshmi, and the courtesans of Agra--women who use the power of fragrance to seduce, tease, and entice. She's on the cusp of a breakthrough when she finds out that the son she never told her husband about is heading to Paris to find her upending her carefully managed world and threatening to destroy a vulnerable marriage.

“She takes up every inch of my head and heart. She was and is all I will ever need.”

Phoebe Wong is on vacation in the States! She is glad to have escaped the dullness of a British Winter with her baby daughter, Jojo. They’ll be staying at a property called ‘Allamanda Grove’ in Key West, thanks to her long-distance American Boyfriend, Carter, who’ll accompany then on this vacation.

But as soon as Phoebe lands on American soil, she is distressed as Carter is unable to come as he is caught up with some important work. The same night, there’s a robbery where she’s staying and she loses her handbag containing all her cards and important documents like her passport. She somehow arranges to get new documents and some cash to get them going in this new place.

Carter’s one day delay turns almost into a whole week and Phoebe can’t decide what to believe anymore. The house she’s staying at seems nothing but hostile, presenting a new challenge everyday. Along with her toddler daughter, she tries her best to make the most of this vacation but is caught up in a messy murder case right after Carter’s arrival!

Does she even know who Carter is and what he’s capable of? Will she be able to get out of this horrible place safely, along with her daughter? Read to know!

I thought this book would be a very interesting fast paced thriller, but I was in for some disappointment. The plot seemed to be leading here and there without any sense of direction. I didn’t enjoy reading this one.

Revolution is in the air!

1792. A tyrannical government is determined to make England a mighty commercial empire. In France, Napoleon Bonaparte begins his rise to power, and with dissent rife, France’s neighbours are on high alert.

Kingsbridge is on the edge!

Unprecedented industrial change sweeps the land, making the lives of the workers in Kingbridge’s prosperous cloth mills a misery. Rampant modernization and dangerous new machinery are rendering jobs obsolete and tearing families apart.

Tyranny is on the horizon!

Now, as international conflict nears, a story of a small group of Kingsbridge people – including spinner Sal Clitheroe, weaver David Shoveller and Kit, Sal’s inventive and headstrong son – will come to define the struggle of a generation as they seek enlightenment and fight for a future free from oppression . . .

Super-excited to start reading this one!

“In a world where you don’t know what will happen next, I just do what I can right now.”

Five people. Five Books. Five Stories. One Library. One Librarian. 

A beautiful heartwarming book comprising of stories of five people at different stages in life trying to cope with their respective problems and trying to find that one thing that can make their lives feel fulfilling. Each of them somehow stumble across the Community House where the Library is situated. The Librarian, Ms. Komachi, recommends everyone a book that they weren’t quite expecting. These books have a huge impact on the people’s lives as they learn things they never thought about and view life with a different fresher perspective!

I can’t describe how much I loved this book. It’s so soothing to read, so relatable and so damn comforting! Please go and read it already!

“I am a haenyeo. Like my mother, and her mother before her, like my sister will be one day, her daughters too - I was never anything but a woman of the sea. Neither you or any man can make me less than that.”

Hana is a haenyeo (Women who dive into the sea to secure their livelihood by gathering seaweed and other sea life), living with her family on the Jeju island in South Korea in 1943. Their country is under Japanese occupation and any woman or girl who is found alone by the soldiers is immediately taken away never to be found again.

When Hana’s little sister, Emiko is born, her mother rests the responsibility of protecting her with Hana. One day, when Hana is diving and watching her sister play on the beach, she spots a Japanese solider nearby. Without thinking twice, Hana hides Emiko from his sight. He sees Hana and calls two soldiers to take her away.

Hana is made ‘comfort woman’ for the Japanese soldiers in Manchuria and suffers indescribably at their hands. The story alternates between what happened to Hana in 1943 in Manchuria and how Emi lives with it in 2011. 

A heartbreaking tale of two sisters separated by war, The White Chrysanthemum is a brilliant book describing the plight of Korean women during world war II. A must read!

“In books, I thought with sadness, people declare their love or hatred for each other, they dare admit to everything they feel in their hearts; why is that impossible in life?”

A semi-autobiographical work by Simone De Beauvoir, The Inseparables, is inspired by the author’s friendship with a woman named Zaza. The protagonist here is Sylvie and her inseparable friend is portrayed by the name Andreé.

Andreé and Sylvie share a one-of-a-kind friendship. Sylvie starts to fall in love with Andreé but eventually finds out that Andreé has different interests. Andreé is bound by her duties towards her family and God. But having things not go her way for a long time starts affecting her adversely, to the point that she hits her own foot with an ax to get away from social duties. Sylvie is deeply affected by Andreé’s anguish and tries her best to get her out of it, but, in the end, it all seems like a vain effort.

I loved the bond and understanding between both of them. These characters were way ahead of their time. I am definitely going to read more of De Beauvoir’s work!

“When someone is in your heart, they're never truly gone. They can come back to you, even at unlikely times.”

This is the story of a man who tries to kill himself, after his only daughter doesn’t invite him for her wedding. It is the last straw against a series of setbacks for him. He goes to his hometown, Pepperville Beach, to visit his childhood home, before taking his life. But, on the way, he gets badly injured in a horrifying accident and as he tries to regain his senses, he sees his dead mother walking towards him!

A beautiful heart-wrenching tale about life, death and everything in between, For one more day is a must read for those who loved Tuesdays with Morrie! I Don’t remember the last time I cried over a book. It’s also my second five star read of 2023!

“…that answers would come and the clouds would clear and the complicated would become simple and the bizarre would become ordinary.”

I’ve loved reading Books by Cecelia Ahern. She writes from her heart and her stories always leave you wanting for more!

This book is about a teenage girl named Tamara. She recently lost her father to suicide and is forced to leave Dublin, along with her mother, as they have nothing left of their once lavish lifestyle. They go to live in the country with her uncle, Arthur and his wife, Rosaleen.

Once there, Tamara longs for home as she starts to feel lonely. Her aunt constantly hovers around the house and raises her curiosity with her strange routine. Tamara is also very concerned about her mother, who seems to do nothing but sleep all day in her room.

One day a travelling library arrives in town. Tamara chooses a leather-bound book with a gold clasp and padlock as it intrigues her endlessly. When she finally get the book open with some help, she is quite astonished with what she finds inside! Will this book make her life interesting again? Read to know!

This book is such a wonderful modern fairytale without a single dull moment! The suspense builds as you turn page after page and you won’t be able to stop till you find the truth!

“On the other hand, wasn't that the very definitely of life? Constant adaptations brought about by a series of never-ending mistakes?”

A book that should be an essential read, Lessons in Chemistry follows the story of Elizabeth Zott, a brilliant scientist who struggles to do research because of societal gender norms. She refuses to give up on her dream, despite the various hurdles in her way, because the belief that she can change the world is deeply rooted within her. I loved her story and her straightforward character inspired me endlessly!

I was quite intrigued to read this book, mostly due to it’s cover. The blurb sounded unique too. But I’ve learned my lesson - not to judge a book by it’s cover!!

This book is about Greta, who lives in Hudson and works as a transcriber for a sex therapist. Thanks to her job, she knows the deepest darkest secrets of almost everyone in town and can easily guess their story whenever she hears their voice around her. Big Swiss is one of the therapist’s clients who claims to never have had an orgasm. Greta comes across her at the Dog Park and lies to her about her identity. An unlikely bond forms between them and they have the time of their lives!

This book just wasn’t my cup of tea. I didn’t enjoy the story and the prose didn’t work for me either. Pick it up at your own risk!

Part 2 of The Housemaid, this book is just as surprising and thrilling as it's prequel. 

The book begins with Millie trying her best to land a job to make ends meet after being recently fired. She gets a call from Douglas Garrick, who lives in an incredible penthouse apartment in the best neighborhood of New York. He is ready to hire her immediately, but for one condition - not to go into the guest bedroom, as his wife is very ill. 

Millie gets a terrible feeling regarding the woman locked up in the guest bedroom, as she hears disturbing noises coming from it every now and then. Her worry ascends when she spots blood around the neckline of a nightgown. One day, she decides that enough is enough and knocks on the door and is left tongue tied after it swings open!

Why is Mr. Garrick hiding his wife? Will Millie know what's going on behind the closed door? Will she be able to help this woman? Read to know!

I just couldn't stop myself from turning page after page of this book till I got to the bottom of the layers and layers of secrets this story unpeeled. A gold mine for mystery readers! Freida is now one of my favourite suspense writers, she is undeniably brilliant!

Blurb:

Fey Adekola wants to learn how to be alive again. It's been five years since the accident that killed the love of her life and she's almost a new person now-an artist with her own studio, and sharing a brownstone apartment with her ride-or-die best friend, Joy, who insists it's time for Fey to ease back into the dating scene. Feyi isn't ready for anything serious, but a steamy encounter at a rooftop party cascades into a whirlwind summer she could have never imagined: a luxury trip to a tropical island, decadent meals in the glamorous home of a celebrity chef, and a major curator who wants to launch her art career. She's even started dating the perfect guy, but their new relationship might be sabotaged before it has a chance by the dangerous thrill Fey feels every time she locks eyes with the one person in the house who is most definitely off-limits. This new life she asked for just got a lot more complicated, and Fey must begin her search for real answers.

Who is she ready to become? Can she release her past and honor her grief while still embracing her future? And, of course, there's the biggest question of all -how far is she willing to go for a second chance at love? Awake Emezi's vivid and passionate writing takes us deep into a world of possibility and healing, and the constant bravery of choosing love against all odds.

I started reading this book sometime last month and didn’t like the way it was progressing so I decided to DNF it. Not my cup of tea.

What a brilliant brilliant brilliant murder mystery! It leaves you guessing right till the end and you can’t keep calm until you discover who the culprit is!

To lay out the background - Viscount Tsubaki has recently died due to suicide. His highly distressed daughter, Mineko, visits Kindaichi San asking for his help with her mother’s strange behaviour. Her mother is convinced that the viscount is still alive. As she narrates this story in detail, it sends chills down Kindaichi’s spine every now and then.

Mineko requests him to attend a divination, conducted in order to get rid of her mother’s doubts regarding her father’s death, at the Tsubaki house. She asks him to be present so that he could better understand the dynamics of their weird family. Some eerie incidents happen that night and the next morning, a dead body is discovered in the same room the divination was held! Whose body is it? Who is the murderer? Read to know!

I read a Japanese murder mystery for the first time and it sure is not going to be my last! Seishi Yokomozi is such a master storyteller. I need to read his other works as soon as possible! Also, what a pretty cover!

I loved this tag so much that I am doing it again this year 😬

🟢What I’ve been Reading this week:
Finished ‘The Devil’s Flute Murders’ yesterday and started reading ‘Begin Again’ today. I am trying my best to squeeze in some reading during and between lectures!

🟢What I’ve been watching 
Nothing interesting actually, just random episodes of good old ‘Friends’ and ‘Permanent Roommates’. Looking forward to be intrigued enough by some new series to watch it.

🟢Other bits and bobs
Well, I am literally in between places right now. Currently, I am travelling every week between my hometown and Aurangabad for my job training. It’s been a bit hectic as I am juggling a lot of things at once, but I am having a lot of fun too!

Blurb:

Shadows at Noon is an ambitious synthesis of decades of research and scholarship which explores the key strands of South Asian history in the twentieth century with clarity and authority. Unlike other narrative histories of the subcontinent that concentrate exclusively on politics, here food, leisure and the household are given equal importance to discussions of nationhood, the development of the state and patterns of migration.

While it tells the subcontinent's story from the British Raj to independence and partition and on to the forging of the modern nations of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the book's structure is thematic rather than chronological. Each of the chapters illuminates on overarching theme or sphere that has shaped South Asia over the course of the century. This format allows the reader to explore particular issues - such as the changing character of nationalism or food consumption - over time and in depth.

Shadows at Noon is a bold, innovative and personal work that pushes back against standard narratives of 'inherent' differences between India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Its purpose is to make contemporary South Asia intelligible to readers who are fascinated by the subcontinent's cultural vibrancy and diversity but are often perplexed by its social and political make-up. And it illuminates the many aspects that its people have in common rather than what divides them.

“And when I look at you, I swear I have. Existed just for you all this time. It feels like I have.”

Natalie is the heiress of the wealthy Vos family of Napa. August is an ex-SEAL who is in Napa to fulfil his dead best friend’s lifelong dream of owning a vineyard. Natalie wants to start her own hedge fund but is short of money for it. Her trust fund will be released only on two conditions - she is employed and married! August does own a vineyard but his wine tastes like absolute piss!

When they first met each other, they felt a mutual attraction. But eventually, they started having little wars with words and became enemies, instead of friends. Somehow they come to the conclusion that they both need to get married so that Natalie could get her trust fund money and August could get some investment so that his wine could taste decent. They decide to end their marriage after a month so that their respective goals are achieved. Will they be successful in doing so? Will they fall for each other in the process? Read to know!

This is a too good to be true small town romance set in the picturesque Napa Valley. I loved August’s and Natalie’s fun banter and their one-of-a-kind chemistry. I just couldn’t get myself to agree over a few things like August being extremely protective of Natalie and treating her like a small delicate thing. Overall, it was a fun read!

“He is the steady pulse of something known, something understood - not a person to build your world around, but a person to build one with.”

Andie’s dream has just come true! She has successfully transferred from community college to the competitive Blue Ridge State, where her parents went. On top of it, her boyfriend, Connor goes there too! But when she knocks on his door on her first day there, to surprise him with her transfer, he’s nowhere to be found. When she calls him, he says he transferred to the community college to be with her. This gives a bitter start to Andie’s new beginning.

Milo is her RA at the dorm, who has a continuous sleeplessness hovering around him. Shay is her roommate, who is also a bookstagrammer, confused about finding her major. Andie’s self-help persona kicks in and she tries her best to help them both. In the process, they become the best of friends and Andie has the time of her life learning new things about her late Mother.

This book was so damn adorable - Andie’s two grandmas, her swearing with her favourite dessert names, academic events and with a lot more interesting tidbits! It was such a nice comforting read!

“This is what I love the most about writing - it offers endless opportunities to reinvent ourselves, and the stories we tell about ourselves. It lets us acknowledge every aspect of our heritage and history.”

I’ll be honest. First time after reading the blurb of this book, I didn’t find the premise that interesting. But as it started garnering quite a few praises around bookstagram, I was quite intrigued to read it and fortunately, I received it as a review copy and started reading it the first chance I got!

This is the story of Athena Liu, a brilliant Asian American writer and her not so good friend, June Hayward, a mediocre white writer. Athena dies due to choking at the beginning of the story, when June is the only person present with her. A few moments before her death, Athena talks to June about her new book - ‘The Last Front’. After Athena dies, June steals her unpublished manuscript and publishes it with her own name.

For the sake of her conscience, June believes that the book wouldn’t have seen the light of the day without her. The book becomes a huge success, turning June into a best selling author overnight. As she is riding the success wave, an accusation of plagiarism comes as a huge obstacle in her way. She overrides it somehow and writes another book with the help of a few scribbled lines from Athena’s notes. She again goes through the same cycle of accusations and is again saved with the help of her agent and publisher.

How long will she enjoy this borrowed success? Will she ever realise her wrongdoings? Read to know!

I’ve rarely read a book where the protagonist is not a good person. It feels a bit disturbing seeing the world from such a perspective, but it also sheds light on how their mind works. This book showcases the ugly side of publishing and what all it takes for a book to become a best seller. It talks about the sheer joy of writing from your heart. It talks about racism. I loved reading Kuang’s prose. It’s fluid, riveting and simply brilliant!

Genre: Sci-fi

This is the thrilling prequel to the masterful space opera ‘To Sleep in a Sea of Stars’.

Set in the year 2234, on the planet Talos VII, twenty-three years before the events of To Sleep in a Sea of Stars, an anomaly is detected: a vast circular pit, with dimensions so perfect that it could only have been the result of conscious design. So a small team is assembled to learn more – perhaps even who built the hole and why. Their mission will take them on a hazardous trek to the very edge of existence.

For one explorer, this is the opportunity of a lifetime. For another, a risk not worth taking. And for xenobiologist Alex Crichton, it’s a desperate attempt to find meaning in an uncaring universe. But every step they take towards that mysterious abyss is more punishing than the last. Ultimately, no one is prepared for what they will encounter.

Millie is desperate for a job. She has just been fired from her most recent one. She is on parole after spending ten years inside a prison. She can’t afford to be unemployed. She lands a job at the Winchesters, that seems too good to be true, given her current situation. She is to clean their house, cook for them and sometimes look after their daughter for a pretty decent salary.

But, from day one, Millie can’t wait to quit this job. Mrs. Nina Winchester turns out to be a horrible woman. She gives Millie the hardest time one can imagine. She deliberately messes up the house for Millie to clean, blames her for forgetting stuff she wasn’t told to do in the first place and so much more. Their daughter is quite the spoilt brat, who throws tantrums every chance she gets. The only person who treats Millie nicely is Nina’s husband, Andrew.

Every-time Millie ventures out for some chore, she meets acquaintances of the Winchesters, who tell her that Nina is a bit flaky and Andrew is such a great person for still being married to her. Millie tries her best not to awaken the crazy in Nina but all her efforts are in vain. Eventually, she gets attracted to Andrew due to his welcoming nature and strikingly handsome features. She senses that he is attracted to her too. But what she is seeing is just what they are willing to show. Will they indulge their attractions? If yes, what will Nina do? Read to know!

This one was such a page-turner! I was hooked right from page one! If you liked Verity, you’ll definitely like this one too. The narration is clean and crisp, the storyline is brilliant and the characters are very well-developed. A must-read for mystery lovers!

“What you resist persists. The only way to let go of all resistance is acceptance.”

A book that is as interesting as it’s title! Divided into four parts, each comprising of five short stories, this book is a masterpiece! All the stories here are award-winning tales of surprise and emotions.

The book is divided into four parts - out of this world, not too far into the future, all doesn’t end well and love comes in all hues. My most favourite story is from the second part, titled ‘Top of the World’ which is a heartbreaking as well as heartwarming story of a girl and her soldier father.

Every story starts normally, and as you are getting used to it’s background, there’s a sudden twist that sends chills down your spine. Based on a variety of themes like science, love, history, family, this collection of stories is captivating at it’s best! A must read for all short story lovers!

Blurb:

""Anyone will tell you the born of this world are marked from the get-out, win or lose."" 

Set in the mountains of southern Appalachia, this is the story of a boy born to a teenaged single mother in a single-wide trailer, with no assets beyond his dead father's good looks and copper-colored hair, a caustic wit, and a fierce talent for survival. 

In a plot that never pauses for breath, relayed in his own unsparing voice, he braves the modern perils of foster care, child labor, derelict schools, athletic success, addiction, disastrous loves, and crushing losses. Through all of it, he reckons with his own invisibility in a popular culture where even the superheroes have abandoned rural people in favor of cities. 

Many generations ago, Charles Dickens wrote David Copperfield from his experience as a survivor of institutional poverty and its damages to children in his society. Those problems have yet to be solved in ours. 

Dickens is not a prerequisite for readers of this novel, but he provided its inspiration. In transposing a Victorian epic novel to the contemporary American South, Barbara Kingsolver enlists Dickens' anger and compassion, and above all, his faith in the transformative powers of a good story. Demon Copperhead speaks for a new generation of lost boys, and all those born into beautiful, cursed places they can't imagine leaving behind.

When Rubani’s long-term boyfriend dumps her and moves out, her three best friends make a decision: It’s about time the serial monogamist had her first one-night stand. 

In a snap, Natasha, Saira and Faiza revive a languishing plan to take a trip to Goa. Over the course of their holiday, the four girls drink, dance and karaoke, even as they nurse old wounds, kindle new romances and discover metamorphic truths about each other – and themselves.

It’s a vacation with all the fixings of a quintessential girls’ trip – emotional drama, secrets unveiled, bonds strengthened – as each friend recounts the one-night stand that changed her life. Amidst swapping stories, Natasha has a mysterious midnight tryst, Saira meets a man who makes her question her disdain for commitment, and Faiza discovers that her ex still gives her butterflies. Rubani, with a mission yet to be accomplished, finds her interest piqued by a girl who’s exactly her type – and a man who isn’t. Now the holiday is drawing to a close and she must make her choice: to be or not to be wild as the Goan winds.

Zany, pacy, soulful and fun, One Night Only is as much an ode to desire and sexuality as it is a celebration of female friendship in all its turbulence and splendour.

“Truly happy memories always live on, shining. Over time, one by one, they come back to life.”

Translated from the Japanese, kitchen comprises of two stories - Kitchen and Moonlight Shadow.

Kitchen is the story of Mikage, who loses all of her family one by one. When she loses her grandmother, the last member of her family, a neighborhood boy, Yuichi, asks her to come and live with him and his mother. But his mother, who goes by the name Eriko, isn’t in-fact his mother, but once used to be his father, before undergoing certain changes to their appearance. This story mainly focuses on how Mikage and Yuichi are united in their grief through a love for food and cooking.

The second story is that of Satsuki, who has recently lost her boyfriend of four years, Hitoshi to a car accident. Her way of coping is to go for an early morning jog everyday. She shares her grief with Hiragii, Hitoshi’s brother, who lost his girlfriend in the same accident. One day, Satsuki meets a strange girl named Urara, on the bridge she jogs to everyday. Urara promises to show her something that happens only once in a hundred years! What is it? Is it something life changing? Read to know!

Both the stories touched my heart in more ways than one. The writing is riveting, poignant and brilliant! A uniquely beautiful novel!

Our planet is facing not one but two crises. In a world where carbon emissions and climate financing are rightly rising up the agenda, there exists another catastrophe that is often overlooked but just as dire-the global collapse of our ecosystems. Siddarth Shrikanth's The Case for Nature presents a compelling vision for tackling this other crisis by rethinking our relationship with nature in economic, social and even personal terms. Shrikanth argues that we can create flourishing economies and societies by preserving and restoring our planet's 'natural capital' and introduces the pioneers of this nature-positive revolution with vivid examples from across the world. But he also calls on readers to reflect on the roots of this crisis, drawing upon indigenous world views to show that nature must be woven into our modern societies, not set apart. By offering a hopeful yet deeply pragmatic perspective on how we can exist in harmony with our living planet, The Case for Nature is a must-read for anyone seeking to understand how nature can help us forge a more sustainable future and what they can do to contribute to this vision.

Girl to Goddess is a book of poetry written by popular Instagram poet Nishi. The poems in the book are deeply personal, touching on universal themes of struggle, pain and healing. Nishi writes candidly about her own struggles with finding happiness, dealing with relationships and the challenges she faced on her journey towards self-acceptance and self-love. She explores the idea of finding the inner divinity, or the goddess within, and how listening to this voice helped her find a sense of peace and purpose. She shares her personal journey of self-discovery and growth.

Through this collection of insightful poems, Nishi takes the reader on a journey of mistakes, failures, fears, lessons, perspectives and realizations about life, love and everything in between. She shares her vulnerabilities and opens up about her deepest emotions. Her words inspire readers to look inwards and embrace their own inner divinity, encouraging them to find their own path towards healing and self-love.

It is a powerful and moving book of poetry that speaks to the struggles of the human experience and how one surmounts them. Nishi's writing is a testament to the power of self-reflection and the importance of finding the goddess within, and her words will resonate with readers long after they've turned the final page.

More than one fifth of children want to become influencers and it's easy to understand why. What if you could escape economic uncertainty by winning the internet's attention? What if you could turn the adoration of your social media followers into a lucrative livelihood?

But as Symeon Brown explores in this searing exposé, the reality is much murkier. From IRL streamers in LA to Brazilian butt lifts, from sex workers on OnlyFans to fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes, these are the incredible stories that lurk behind the filtered selfies and gleaming smiles.

Exposing the fraud, exploitation, bribery, and dishonesty at the core of the influencer model, Get Rich or Lie Trying asks if our digital rat race is costing us too much. Revealing a broken economy resembling a pyramid scheme, this incredible blend of reportage and analysis will captivate and horrify you in equal measure.

DM @thewritersoasis","THE LONDON SÉANCE SOCIETY 

1873. At an abandoned château on the outskirts of Paris, a dark séance is about to take place, led by acclaimed spiritualist Vaudeline D’Allaire. Known worldwide for her talent in conjuring the spirits of murder victims to ascertain the identities of the people who killed them, she is highly sought after by widows and investigators alike.

Lenna Wickes has come to Paris to find answers about her sister’s death, but to do so, she must embrace the unknown and overcome her own logic-driven bias against the occult. When Vaudeline is beckoned to England to solve a high-profile murder, Lenna accompanies her as an understudy. With shared determination, the women find companionship that perhaps borders on something more. And as they team up with the powerful men of London’s exclusive Séance Society to solve the mystery, they begin to suspect that they are not merely out to solve a crime, but perhaps entangled in one themselves…

DM @thewritersoasis","MOMS IN THE WILD

Sneha Talwar is an idealistic young reporter on an assignment to profile Natasha Babani, environmental activist and multi-talented mommy-influencer, who has spent the last year cleaning up a polluted lake.

But before she can get started, Natasha's body is found floating in that very lake. As Sneha swiftly changes gear and begins to dig around for information on Natasha, she unearths a whole 'mommy universe' that thrives on its own rules, rivalries and intrigues.

Moms in the Wild is a dark, funny and razor-sharp story about the perilous world of social media, replete with murderous secrets, complicated lies and how far people will go to keep them.

When the dead come back to haunt the living, Lockwood & Co. step in ... For more than fifty years, the country has been affected by a horrifying epidemic of ghosts. A number of Psychic Investigations Agencies have sprung up to destroy the dangerous apparitions. Lucy Carlyle, a talented young agent, arrives in London hoping for a notable career. Instead she finds herself joining the smallest, most ramshackle agency in the city, run by the charismatic Anthony Lockwood.

When one of their cases goes horribly wrong, Lockwood & Co. have one last chance of redemption. Unfortunately this involves spending the night in one of the most haunted houses in England, and trying to escape alive. Set in a city stalked by spectres, The Screaming Staircase is the first in a chilling new series full of suspense, humour and truly terrifying ghosts.

In the wake of China’s invasion of Tibet throughout the 1950s, Lhamo and her younger sister, Tenkyi, arrive at a refugee camp in Nepal. They survived the dangerous journey across the Himalayas, but their parents did not. 

As Lhamo—haunted by the loss of her homeland and her mother, a village oracle—tries to rebuild a life amid a shattered community, hope arrives in the form of a young man named Samphel and his uncle, who brings with him the ancient statue of the Nameless Saint—a relic known to vanish and reappear in times of need. 

Decades later, the sisters are separated, and Tenkyi is living with Lhamo’s daughter, Dolma, in Toronto. While Tenkyi works as a cleaner and struggles with traumatic memories, Dolma vies for a place as a scholar of Tibetan Studies. But when Dolma comes across the Nameless Saint in a collector’s vault, she must decide what she is willing to do for her community, even if it means risking her dreams. 

Breathtaking in its scope and powerful in its intimacy, We Measure the Earth with Our Bodies is a gorgeously written meditation on colonization, displacement and the lengths we’ll go to remain connected to our families and ancestral lands. Told through the lives of four people over fifty years, this novel provides a nuanced, moving portrait of the littleknown world of Tibetan exiles.

In August 2011, Shahbar Tascer was drivine to his office in Lahore, Pakistan, when he was dragged hon his ear at gunpoint and kidnapped by a group of Taliban-affiliated terrorists.

Just seven months carlier, his father. Salman Tascer, the governor of Punjab Province, had been shot dead by his guard for speaking out against Pakistan's blasphemy laws.

For almost five years Shahbaz was held captive, moved ever deeper into the lawless Hindu Kush, frequently tortured and forced to endure extreme cruelty, his fate resting on his kidnappers impossible demands and the uneasy alliances between his captors, the Taliban and ISIS.

Lost to the World is the remarkable true story of Taser's time in captivity and of his astonishing escape. It is a story of extraordinary faith, bravery and sorrow, with moments of kindness, humour and empathy, offering a hopeful light in the dark vears of his imprisonment.

While deeply harrowing, this tale is also about resilience. Taseer countered his captors' narrative of a holy war by immersing himself in the Quran in search of hope and a means to see his own humanity under even the most inhumane conditions, and ultimately to find a way back to his family.

“But if you cannot change your situation, then, you have no choice. You can only change how you think about it.”

A riveting story of two middle-aged women whose paths cross due to a pair of shoes! 

Sam lives in London, with her husband, Phil and daughter, Cat. She has a job that she’s trying very hard not to lose, as she is the only one earning in their house. On top of that, her ageing parents expect her to come and clean for them twice a week, her depressed husband is always in front of the television and does next to nothing in helping her keep the house going. Her friend, Andrea, who is fighting cancer, is the only one keeping her sane.

Nisha has everything anyone could ever ask for. A freakishly rich husband, clothes that scream lavishness and a son whom she loves above anything in the world. But, one day, her husband completely locks her out of everything she owns, even her clothes! He has meticulously planned to initiate their divorce proceedings for months and Nisha has no clue how or why!

Both their bags get exchanged at the gym. A set of amusing, life-changing, frustrating and interesting events unfold, which leads them to discover their true and authentic selves!

I loved each and every bit of this book. The beauty of female friendships and the need for communication in a relationship are the core themes here. Jojo Moyes is simply outstanding!

“Happiness is holding someone in your arms and knowing you hold the whole world.”

Personally, I keep my distance from anything related to politics. But this particular book, changed my view on the subject and piqued my interest significantly.

This Book is set in the town of Kars, Turkey in the nineties. A journalist is visiting this sleepy town from Frankfurt, Germany. He is a political exile from Turkey. He is here for the love of a woman called Ïpek. She has recently separated from her husband and stays with her father in their hotel. His other motive is to write an article about the suicide epidemic that has been plaguing this town for quite a while.

As the snow begins to fall, our journalist, Ka, arrives amidst a whirlwind of politics and drama. The young women of this town are prone to commit suicide due to various reasons. There is a religious war going on between the supporters of Islam and the open-minded Europe-favouring atheists. The head of the intelligence service is constantly on alert due to all these happenings. All Ka cares about is taking Ïpek back to Germany with him after the blizzard clears. Will he be able to do so? If yes, at what cost? Read to know!

This book is translated to English from the Turkish language. The prose is quite brilliant and the story is quite an eyeopener! This book is not everyone’s cup of tea, but I liked reading it!

“Our Love is a place we can always come back to, and it will be waiting, the same as it ever was.”

I discovered Books by Emily Henry two years ago. I finished ‘Beach Read’ and ‘People we meet on vacation’ in one sitting. Then, last year, I read ‘Book Lovers’, which I didn’t enjoy as much. But, with ‘Happy Place’, I fell in love with her writing again! Her Books are fun, but they also have a certain depth and intensity to them.

This is the story of Harriet and Wyn. Harriet has prepared her whole life to become a brain surgeon. She met Wyn at university via mutual friends and they took their time in falling for each other. But once they discovered how happy they made each other, there was no turning back, until five months ago!

Every year they take a week long vacation with their best friends in Knott’s harbour. A house that is Harriet’s happiest place in the world, owing to loads of fond memories made there. This year, it’s a bit different though, as they have kept their friends in the dark regarding their broken relationship. And they can’t tell them till the week is done, as two of their friends are getting married! 

A beautiful story about second-chance romance, Happy Place is a book I really enjoyed reading! It talks about Love, Passion, Romance and Friendship wonderfully with quite relatable characters. A must-read new release!

The most popular and widely talked about reality show in India has to be Shark Tank! It’s not only entertaining but also quite insightful as well as knowledgable. 

Everyone can’t get enough of the Sharks and their business brilliance. For anyone who wants to own a start-up, this book is for you! It is packed with straight-forward, no-bullshit advice, loads of inspiring stories and leadership lessons from the Sharks and the participants.

It’ll teach you important and interesting things like why Anupam thinks panic is a good thing, how Amit nearly sunk his first business, the many pivots Vineeta made before she hit jackpot, how Peyush’s mentors helped him, why Namita thinks you need more women in your team and how Aman found the perfect co-founder!

Thank you @juggernaut.in for the review copy!

“I don’t think most people ever know how to do anything really. The trick about life is realising that everyone is making it up as they go, all the time.”

I’ve never read a murder mystery like this one before. It is about a woman named Claire, who is a medium, which means a person who can help others communicate with ghosts! She has her own ghost cum friend, Sophie, who is her constant companion.

She gets invited to the Cloisters by Figgy, who had been her classmate, for an event. Her family are the Wellington-Forges, who live in quite a foreboding mansion full of ghosts. Claire has been called to offer ghostly entertainment for their Nana’s birthday. 

To Claire’s great dismay, Nana is found dead the next day! But she can talk to her ghost, which tells her that there is a murder mystery to be solved, but there is no body or it’s identification to start with! Will Claire be able to solve this unsolvable case with the help of her ‘special abilities’? Read to know!

I didn’t quite enjoy the mystery element in this book as it didn’t intrigue me as much as I had expected. But there are quite a few moments here that’ll surely give you a good laugh!

Thank you @penguinindia and @reader_viddh for the review copy!

“She walked home through the darkening glade, singing of the stars; and the trees stood still and listened to her, and the mountains were glad.”
Ruskin Bond, The Blue Umbrella

Ruskin Bond is one of the finest writers of India. Yesterday was his 89th birthday. This book contains some of the best stories written by him. My favourite one is 'The Blue Umbrella'.

It also contains other masterpieces like 'Angry River' and 'Panther's Moon' that were written early in the writer's career. The more recent ones like 'Rhododendrons in the Mist' and 'Miracle at Happy Bazaar' are also included.

All of these wonderful stories remain as golden as they were when they were first published. This book is no less than treasure for those who love to read!

Thank you @alephbookco for the review copy!

“Everything is going to be all right. Or, if not, everything is going to be, so let's not worry.”

This is the fourth Book I read by Matt Haig. Like always, his words are a joy to read as they are relatable as well as comfortable at the same time.

This book is about a man called Tom Hazard, who is more than four centuries old. He is overwhelmed with the memories of his past and his constant search for his long lost daughter. In the midst of all this, he has to remain cautious so as not to reveal his special condition of slowed ageing to the ordinary people around him, in order to avoid disastrous consequences.

I hadn’t heard of this Book before they announced the movie. I read the blurb and was intrigued enough to order it right away! Loved every bit of it!

“Respect could build an empire. Trust could make it unbreakable. Love could make it last forever.”
-Scarlett St. Clair, A Touch of Darkness (Hades & Persephone, #1)

Persephone is the Goddess of spring, just for the sake of a name. Flowers have only shrivelled at her touch since she was a little girl. She hoped to live a life of quiet disguised as a mortal journalist when she moved to New Athens. All that takes a backseat when she sits down in a forbidden nightclub to play a hand of cards with a completely mysterious and hypnotic stranger.

The God of the Dead, Hades, has built a gambling empire in the mortal world. His favourite bets are said to be impossible. But the most intriguing bargain of all for him is the goddess’s offering.

After a meeting with Hades, Persephone enters a contract with terms that sound almost impossible. She is required to create life in the Underworld or stand to lose her freedom forever. All that the bet does is expose her failure as a goddess. As she struggles for her freedom, she starts falling in love with Hades. This love is captivating as well as forbidden. What will be its consequences? Read to know!
